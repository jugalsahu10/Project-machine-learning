Few Projects executed

1) Boston Marathon World Run 

A virtual marathon application. It enables users to pledge running distances which they intend
to cover. The app taps into social media to provide the user with related updates about the 
event and also about activities of like minded people relating to the Boston marathon.
Challenges in the project
◦ To create a visual delight to the users across all screens.
◦ Creating custom views.
◦ To integrate with third party API providers.
◦ Co-ordinating with other 3rd party developers.

2) OlaCabs Driver Application
This Application drives the core business of OlaCabs.It is reponsible for bill calculation,serving 
booking,distance,wait time which play major role in the business model in any Cab service provider.
Challenges in the project

◦ Developing Kiosk mode for all devices
◦ Building an stable application which works 24*7 in foreground.
◦ Exploring new techology to get better results.

3) Celebrity Clicks
This is a fun application. It enables users to use a cutout from a given set of celebrity cutouts and 
juxtapose the same with a live camera image. It has features to make these juxtaposed images look 
real by resizing, repositioning, and adjusting brightness, saturation and contrast of the celebrity

cutout. Additional features included application of various effects(pencil sketch, grey-scale etc) to 
the picture. 

Challenges in the project
◦ Creating custom camera view and custom views.
◦ Image manipulations (Creating effects).
◦ Handling memory issues.

4) MT Monitor application – A hybrid application

This was an enterprise application. The application was used to monitor onboard diagnostics  
of cars remotely. It had features which enabled a user to register the new onboard device by 
using NFC's or barcode's.

 Was involved in the development of the business logic for this application. Have used SOAP 

calls to communicate with backend servers.
Challenges in the project
◦ Developing hybrid applications was challenging because the technology was new.
◦ Understanding technologies like NFC, SOAP.

5) A Survey Library

This library exposed API's using which the developer could create surveys.
Challenges in the project
◦ All the UI was built dynamically rather inflating the UI using the XML file.
◦ Assets needed for the UI could not stored and accessed in a conventional way as we were 

building a library and not an application.

6) Tennis Game(Flappy Bird type)

A game built using libgdx(game platform) ,similar to flappy bird game.
Challenges in the project
◦ Using a new platform to build games.
◦ Understanding the dynamics of game development.

 Communication of IPV6 networks over an IPV4 network

Project was done as a part of the academic requirement in B.E.

It aimed to achieve communication between two ipv6 hosts which were connected via an 
existing ipv4 network. This communication is achieved using the concept of tunneling.
The implementation makes use of hooks provided by the kernel to trigger our tunneling 
module. The isolated system has a relay router where the ipv6 packets are intercepted. An 
ipv4 header is then added to this packet before being sent along its path.
The receiver receives packets through another rely router. This rely router has our tunneling 
module which removes the ipv4 header and sends the ipv6 packet to the receiver.
Tunneling was implemented as a dynamic kernel module. The advantage being that the same 
could be inserted into the kernel when the kernel was running.
