Description:
A  digital  signature  is  a  mathematical  scheme  for   demonstrating  the
authenticity of digital message or document .In  traditional  systems  there
is no guarantee that a data that has been sent is secured  or not. In  those
systems the data  can  be  altered  while  transmission.  To  overcome  this
problem we go for digital  signatures  which  provide  authentication,  data
integrity and a secure transfer of messages from sender to receiver.
