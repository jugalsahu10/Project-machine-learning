|Work Experience                                                         |


 Working at iAccept Software pvt.ltd as an software Engineer.
 Experience:1 Year

|PROJECTS                                                                |

    . iAccept

Skill Used: Core Java,Struts2 MVC With Hibernate,MySql,HTML,css.

iAccept is an ethical bridge.This is an e-Notarizing site. This is the ONLY
portal bridging the gap between employers and job seekers with a secured
and reliable, independent 3rd party Authentication service. The portal
ensures that a job seeker has ONLY ONE confirmed job contract at any point
of time, though a candidate is at liberty to explore multiple options. This
portal is sector independent and is equally applicable for all sectors like
IT/ITES, BPO, BFSI etc.

Benefits to Job Seeker:
The portal provides an independent, confidential attesting and
authentication service to the job seekers who have received job offers
For companies, who do not give a proper release letter, job seekers can use
the portal to route their resignations and thus be able to produce an
experience certificate, provided they had accepted their employer's offer
through the portal.
Benefits to Employer:
The employers suffer a huge loss of lead time because of "No Shows" on the
day of joining after the offers have been accepted. Every employer at some
point of time has been at the receiving end and has suffered because of the
"No shows".
Employers can use the portal to get firm offer acceptances after releasing
a mutually agreed job offer. The numbers of offers made to acceptances
increase with a fewer "No Shows", helping the employer to plan better and
thus keep a lower bench. BPO's have found the feature of flagging
"Absconding" cases useful, where new employees vanish after a few days on
the job.

    . VaultOnCloud


Skill Used: Core Java,Struts2 MVC With Hibernate,MySql,HTML,css.

A secure place where your relieving letters are parked. Potential  employers
can request the job seeker to share the link and validate the same  in  real
time. Past employers need not assign dedicated resource  to  answer  queries
about ex-employees.

Benefits:
When  an  individual  gets  a  job,  the  prospective  employer   invariably
commissions   a   background   verification   exercise    for    educational
qualifications, professional experience etc. This takes time  and  sometimes
wrong details get  reported.  In  some  cases,  verification  does  not  get
completed, for various reasons.
Advantage for Employer:
Employers need not dedicate  resources  to  dig  out  old  data  from  their
records and answer  queries  that  come  from  external  agencies  or  other
employers.

Advantage for Employer:
Employers need not dedicate resources to dig out old data from their
records and answer queries that come from external agencies or other
employers.
