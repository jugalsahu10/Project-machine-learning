Projects

Masters Thesis:  Enhancement of pitch estimation characteristics in Generalized Spectrum

For my masters degree program, I worked in the field of pitch detection and estimation in audio signals. The existing algorithm for obtaining the pitch information was based on Generalized Spectrum analysis. Although the existing algorithm performed well in detecting pitch in a segment, its pitch estimation results were poor when compared to the conventional methods such as Autocorrelation and Cepstrum.

Responsibilities:

Develop a new pitch detection and estimation algorithm based on generalized spectrum
Enhance the pitch estimation characteristics using Linear Prediction and Filter bank methods
Performance evaluation of the new algorithm on a sample data set of audio signals
Compare performance of new algorithm with conventional Autocorrelation and Cepstrum techniques

Environment: Matlab


Client:		Center for Computational Sciences, University of Kentucky
Project: 	ParamChem
Duration: 	March 2009  August 2013

Project Description:

The objective is to develop an integrated cyber environment to address the simulation needs of molecular sciences and automate the parametrization of molecular force fields. The project involves development of platform independent 3D molecular editor, system to generate input data required for optimization procedures, deployment of services to process input data, client-server workflows to submit jobs and retrieve data, setting up of middle ware to delegate job submission to various HPC resources and data archival.

Responsibilities:

Designed web pages using HTML, PHP and JavaScript
Responsible for setting up MySQL database for user registration and allocation request processing
Developed a script to migrate user data from text file based storage to RDMS
Integrated the registration and allied systems with an external grid computing system - GridChem
Upgraded the web services on the middleware server to Axis 2.0
Ant scripts were developed to automate build and deployment process
Compiled and deployed CGenFF and OpenBabel services on Linux server
Involved in the development of GUI client software  ParamCad
Integrated the ParamCad to another GridChem GUI client
Implemented an end-end job submission workflow to process molecular input files
Developed PERL and Shell scripts to support job submission and processing of molecular input files

Environment:  Java Swings, Java OpenGL, Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, Hibernate, Axis 2.0, PERL, AJAX, PHP, HTML, JavaScript

Project:	Commercial Lending System
Duration:	October 2007  February 2008

Project Description:

The project is a request for proposal to automate the front end processing of banks commercial lending system. The proposed method comprised of three stages:  1) user interface to accept scanned copies/images of the documents 2) OCR software to interpret the text and barcode information 3) business process workflow to pre-validate and delegate workflow notifications.

Responsibilities:

Customized JSP s for workflow pages
Developed client side validation and notification windows using JavaScript
Bug fixing and testing of in-house built custom rules engine
Setup and configure the OCR software to batch process the input documents

Environment: J2EE, Eclipse, Fuego BPM, MySQL
